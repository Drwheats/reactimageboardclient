Welcome to Ben dot Place! A place to post with your friends!
Run npm start to start the program in development mode.
The app connects to fugserver, which is hosted at fuggo.lol in a google cloud instance
This app is supposed to mimic the behaviour of 4chan, but in React.

COMMANDS:
Click a post number to reply to it, or type @POSTNUMBER to reply.
The > makes text green until next newline.
Hyperlinking not supported yet (waiting to see if this technology catches on before I implement it)

RULES:
Have fun and be yourself!
Character limit of 3000, limit of 5 posts per 10 minutes.
I don't remember the image size limit.

There is not much else to it. It's an imageboard written in react.
